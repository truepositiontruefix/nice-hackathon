This repository contains a sample sandbox Postman collection for TrueFix Location API.

The TrueFix Server Location API provides access to positioning information derived from the analysis of Wi-Fi access points and cell towers in known locations.  The client applications make XML-over-HTTPS POST calls to the Location Server API providing a listing of observed access points and cell towers within range of the client device, along with GPS information if available. The Location Server API returns a calculated geographic location based on those inputs.
